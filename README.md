Diego Recht Final Project

This project was completed by Diego Recht in partial fulfilment of ECON-UB.0232,
Data Bootcamp, Fall 2017. I certify that the NYU Stern Honor Code applies to this project. In
particular, I have:

Clearly acknowledged the work and efforts of others when submitting written work as our own.

The incorporation of the work of others–including but not limited to their ideas, data, creative expression, and direct quotations (which should be designated with quotation marks), or para-
phrasing thereof– has been fully and appropriately referenced using notations both in the text and the bibliography.

And I understand that:Submitting the same or substantially similar work in multiple courses, either in the same semester
or in a different semester, without the express approval of all instructors is strictly forbidden.
I acknowledge that a failure to abide by NYU Stern Honor Code will result in a failing grade for
the project and course.

Project Description

This project aims to analze the relationship between the volume traded and the percent change in price. By having a working knowledge of the impact volume has on price, I can then create a generic trading scheme to exploit the volatility present in the cryptocurrency market.
